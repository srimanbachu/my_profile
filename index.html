    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Sriman, <br> a 17-year-old currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science <br> at 100x Schools of
      Technology, Greater Noida. I’m passionate about coding, <br> building projects, and exploring new technologies
      that can create real-world impact.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy experimenting with ideas, solving puzzles, and working on <br> creative projects like
      game development and web applications. <br> My goal is to continuously grow as a developer while contributing to
      meaningful innovations.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I explore hobbies like sketching, reading about business, photography <br>fitness, music, and
      gaming, which keep me balanced and inspired.</p>
    <p>I see myself as an intelligent and curious learner who is always excited to take on <br> challenges, learn new
      skills, and push boundaries.</p>
